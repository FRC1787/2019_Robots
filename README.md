# Robot Code for the 2019 Season

## Contributing
If you are adding/working on features, please create a new branch (or use the existing branch for that feature if it exists), and commit/push your changes there. Before committing, make sure your code will at least compile without errors. **Do not do any work in the master branch**, all changes should be made in separate branches, including bug fixes. Once the bugs have been fixed or the features completed, they should be merged into the master branch (production code) via a pull request. Before merging a pull request, make sure that your code doesn't break the code in the master branch.
